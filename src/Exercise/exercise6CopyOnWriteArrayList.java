        üß† What is CopyOnWriteArrayList?
           It is a thread-safe variant of ArrayList where all mutative operations (add, set, remove, etc.) are implemented by making a fresh copy of the underlying array.

            ‚úÖ Key Concepts:
            Safe to use in multi-threaded environments.
            Reading is fast because there's no locking.
            Writing (adding/removing) is expensive because a new copy is created every time.

            ‚úÖ When to Use It?
            Use CopyOnWriteArrayList when:
            You have many reads and very few writes.
            You want thread safety without synchronized or manual locking.
            Typical use cases:
            Caching
            Subscriber list in event systems
            Configuration values

         Problem: Safe Iteration While Modifying
         Suppose you have a list of online users.
         If a user named "guest" is found, you want to add a note "temporary user" while still iterating.

         Without CopyOnWriteArrayList (just ArrayList):
         This throws ConcurrentModificationException.
         */

        List<String> onlineUsers = new ArrayList<>();

        onlineUsers.add("user1");
        onlineUsers.add("user2");
        onlineUsers.add("guest");

        System.out.println("Online Users: " + onlineUsers);

        for (int i = 0; i < onlineUsers.size(); i++) {
            System.out.println("Checking user: " + onlineUsers.get(i));

            if(onlineUsers.get(i).equalsIgnoreCase("guest")){
                onlineUsers.add("temporary user");
                System.out.println("Added 'temporary user' while iterating.");
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Updated Online Users: " + onlineUsers);


        /*
        üß† What's Happening Inside:
        When we add during iteration, CopyOnWriteArrayList creates a new copy of the array, adds the new item,
        and swaps the internal reference.

        The current loop continues on the original snapshot of the list ‚Äî no crash!

        ‚ö†Ô∏è When NOT to Use It:
            Not good for frequent writes.
            If you need to update the list often or with large data, use:
            Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>())
            ConcurrentLinkedQueue or other java.util.concurrent structures.

        Problem: Multi-threaded Chat Room Example
        Imagine a chat room where:
        One thread adds new users.
        Another thread reads the list of users and prints them.
        This is perfect for CopyOnWriteArrayList since:
        Reads are frequent, and
        Writes happen, but they don't block reads.

        List<String> users = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();

        üß† How This Works:
        CopyOnWriteArrayList ensures:
        No ConcurrentModificationException even when writing while reading.
        Each read gets a consistent snapshot of the list.
        Internally, each add() operation creates a new copy of the array and updates the reference.
        This avoids locking and keeps reads super fast.

        | Operation         | Behavior                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Add while reading | ‚úÖ Safe, no exception                     |
| Thread-safe?      | ‚úÖ Yes, no need for `synchronized` blocks |
| Performance       | ‚úÖ Fast reads, ‚ö†Ô∏è slower writes           |
